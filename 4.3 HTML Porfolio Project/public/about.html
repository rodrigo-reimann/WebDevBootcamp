<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello World! 
  I am Rodrigo, a relentless explorer of ideas and life’s 
  diverse paths. My journey has transitioned me through varied roles, 
  from forestry to climate change advocacy, and now to the world of 
  technology, bridging geographies from Brazil to Canada.
</p>

<p>
  With a foundational background in forestry, 
  I ventured into the climate change sector, collaborating with a diverse 
  range of partners to guide organizations toward sustainable futures. 
  Through this experience, I identified a significant opportunity where 
  technology and environmental stewardship intersect, paving the way for a 
  rapid and equitable shift towards a sustainable future.
</p>

<p>
  Motivated by this realization, I am on a path to learning new technologies. 
  My aim is to integrate this knowledge with my background in sustainability, 
  fostering innovative solutions that address our pressing challenges 
  at the intersection of tech and sustainability.
</p>

<p>
  This portfolio will follow this journey,
  showing my learning path and including green insights whenevr I am able to. 
</p>

<p>
  Let’s connect and collaborate to script a future where every click 
  is a step towards a greener tomorrow.
